Room Name: CyberStart: Your First Step In

Room Code: cyberstart_ssh_nik

‚úçÔ∏è Introduction
This room is designed to simulate a beginner-level penetration testing engagement where users apply common cybersecurity principles to discover and analyze vulnerabilities that might be found in real-world scenarios.
The task focuses on gathering publicly available information, identifying weak points, and understanding common mistakes that developers and organizations make.

Throughout the room, participants learn how to approach the process of information gathering, uncovering weak passwords, and identifying sensitive files that can lead to security breaches.

üß© Task 1: Information Gathering
Scenario Overview:
We start by gathering basic information from an internal note leak. This data contains critical information about the email address, the development website, and a temporary password.

Key Concepts:
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): In penetration testing, OSINT refers to the practice of collecting publicly available data about an organization. In this case, we gather important internal details that have been accidentally exposed.
Attack Surface: The more information an attacker can gather, the larger the attack surface becomes. In this scenario, leaking email addresses, subdomains, and passwords increases the potential avenues for exploitation.
Real-World Application:
Many breaches are caused by oversharing sensitive information internally, like leaving backup emails or development passwords unprotected.
Using weak passwords (like temporary passwords) is another mistake that often leads to easy exploitation.
üß© Task 2: Password Cracking Analysis
Scenario Overview:
In this task, we analyze a temporary password that has been exposed. The password SkyHigh2025!test was leaked, which contains several unnecessary components.

Key Concepts:
Password Complexity: This password follows a common password policy structure, but it‚Äôs still weak. It combines a year, a special character, and a test word, which makes it easy to guess or brute-force.
Password Cracking: Attackers can use dictionary attacks or brute force techniques to crack passwords. It‚Äôs essential to use strong, complex passwords that are not predictable.
Real-World Application:
Developers sometimes use simple temporary passwords like these to quickly deploy applications or services, which leaves systems vulnerable.
Organizations must ensure they use unique and strong passwords for each application and service to prevent unauthorized access.
üß© Task 3: Sensitive File Discovery
Scenario Overview:
In many real-world scenarios, developers make mistakes by leaving backup files (like .bak or .zip files) publicly accessible on the server.

Key Concepts:
Backup Files Exposure: Backup files often contain critical code or database dumps that can contain sensitive data or credentials.
File Enumeration: In a penetration test, the goal is to identify exposed files that may contain hidden information or flaws. Tools like DirBuster or gobuster are often used to find files like index.php.bak or .old files.
Real-World Application:
Many breaches are caused by misconfigured servers that leave backup files exposed. These files might contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or other critical details.
It‚Äôs essential to follow best practices for web server configuration, ensuring that backup files are removed and hidden from public access.
üß© Task 4: Combining Information for Exploitation
Scenario Overview:
The final task involves taking all the information gathered so far (email, password, backup file, etc.) and combining it to understand how attackers might exploit these weak points.

Key Concepts:
Combining Information: Attackers use the process of linking multiple pieces of information together to form a complete understanding of the target‚Äôs infrastructure.
Exploitation: Once attackers gather enough information (email addresses, leaked passwords, exposed files), they may attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities (like weak passwords, unpatched services, or exposed backup files) to gain unauthorized access.
Real-World Application:
Defense in Depth: Organizations must employ a multi-layered defense strategy to prevent attackers from exploiting basic mistakes. This involves implementing strong access controls, patch management, encryption, and proper file access permissions.
Social Engineering Risk: Attackers can also use gathered information for social engineering attacks like phishing, where they impersonate legitimate contacts or use leaked emails and passwords to deceive users into providing further access.
üèÜ Conclusion
This room simulates some of the common vulnerabilities that can arise during a penetration testing engagement, teaching how to identify and exploit weak points in an organization‚Äôs publicly accessible information.

Key Takeaways:
OSINT can uncover vital data that could compromise an organization‚Äôs security.
Weak passwords and temporary credentials are often an easy target for attackers.
Sensitive files like backup files must be carefully managed and protected.
Combining multiple data points is a common tactic in social engineering and exploit development.
Penetration testers must keep these concepts in mind when securing a system, ensuring that all aspects, from email addresses to exposed backup files, are appropriately protected.

This room also emphasizes the importance of thinking like an attacker and being aware of simple yet effective real-world mistakes that can leave systems exposed to exploitation.

This room highlights practical, real-world security lessons that are fundamental for anyone looking to start their journey into cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
